This paper studies how mutation frequency distributions vary under different growth models with various death rates and selection rates. A comparison of these distributions was made using two and three dimensional Eden models. The results compare well with previous literature and also show that these distributions may not be as useful at detecting the presence of selection in tumours as they were previously thought to be.
